# Calculator_CPP
**Infix to Postfix Expression Converter (C++)**

This C++ project implements an Calculator that uses infix to postfix expression conversion using core data structures: arrays, stacks, and queues. The program takes infix mathematical expressions as input from the user, converts them into their equivalent postfix notation, and then provides the result of analysis of each expression as the output.

**Key Features:**

* **Infix to Postfix Conversion:** Implements an algorithm to convert infix to postfix expressions.
* **Data Structures:** Leverages arrays, stacks, and queues for efficient processing and storage of expression components.
* **Continuous Input:** Prompts the user for new infix expressions until the command "QUIT" is entered.
* **Analysis Output:** The program continues to output an analysis of the expressions processed, i.e., results of the evaluations, upon receiving each command until "QUIT" command is received.
* **C++ Implementation:** Written in standard C++.
* **Educational Purpose:** Developed as part of a C++ programming assignment in OOPs demonstrating the use of fundamental data structures, different software design patterns (Command pattern, abstract factory pattern, template pattern), following different Software Design principles.

**Intended Use:**

This repository serves as a submission for a OOPs Software Engineering (C++) assignment and can be used as a reference for understanding the implementation of Calculator using infix to postfix conversion using basic data structures.

**Further Development:** Will add in more classes or functionalities as per the assignment requirements in future such as:
* Handle more complex mathematical operators and functions.
* Improve error handling for invalid input expressions.
* Developing Frontend
